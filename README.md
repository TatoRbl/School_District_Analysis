# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis

    We discover that 9th of Thomas School have altered grades so we need to do our analysis again taking out that students

## Summary

  First when i replace the 9th grade of THS with NaNs, the grades of all school get really afected because the total students of THS were more than the ones with grades.
  So when we make a database with only the grades of 10th, 11th and 12th grades, the total school average get with high grades.
  
  So when we redo the analysis with the new grades of the THS we can se now that:
    Charters school have better grades than distric schools
    overall schools with low quantity of students have better grades than schools with high quantity of students
    We can see how schools with higer budget have worst grades.
    But the correct recomentation must be create new schools in district areas.
    If district areas have more schools it will have less students and can have better grades.
